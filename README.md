# UpdatedPoem

This is an updated version of my poetry project for my creative coding project. 
This assignment used Google Colab notebooks and we were tasked with generating poetry. I used the Great Gatsby text, archived from Project Gutenburg, and generated a poem randomly using text blob. More information on the process of this poem can be read at: http://hannahiz.com/creativecoding/?p=37

Please keep in mind that if you are using Google Colab you must re-upload the file you choose to use each time you reopen the file as it does not save. The text I used is attached to this repository.
