# UpdatedPoem

This is an updated version of my poetry project for my creative coding project. 
This assignment used Google Colab notebooks and we were tasked with generating poetry. I used the Great Gatsby text, archived from Project Gutenburg, and generated a poem randomly using text blob. More information on the process of this poem can be read at: http://hannahiz.com/creativecoding/?p=37
